Credit-card-validator-system
This is a Credit card validator system which i created using simple Django and an ensemble of machine learning and deep learning algorithms

the machine learning algorithms were ensembled using a technique called stacking thus having a number of weak learners and a meta learner in the structure of this algorithm.

the machine learning algorithms used include: ->Support Vector Machine ->Ada Boost algorithm ->Random Forest Algorithm ->KNN ->HistGradientBoostingClassifier ->Decision Tree algorithm all of which are classifiers
